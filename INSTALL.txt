# Thanks for using EASEA.
 
Easea can be build using two method.

1)By GNU Makefile:
  $ make
  $ . install.sh [local]  

1)By CMake:
  $ cmake .
  $ make
  $ . install.sh [local] 

"." is equivalent to "source".

Easea can either be installed locally without special permission or in 
/usr/local/ with root permissions.

Once installed, one can test its installation by compiling easea test programs
in example/ :
$ cd example/weierstrass
$ easea weierstrass.ez
$ make 
$ ./weierstrass

To print all options available type:
$ ./weierstrass --help

To test the CUDA version (Need the CUDA developper kit found at
