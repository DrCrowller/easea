The EASEA-CLOUD platform
========================

Overview
--------------
EASEA and EASEA-CLOUD are Free Open Source Software (under GNU Affero v3 General Public License) developed by the SONIC (Stochastic Optimisation and Nature Inspired Computing) group of the BFO team at Universit√© de Strasbourg. Through the Strasbourg Complex Systems Digital Campus, the platforms are shared with the UNESCO CS-DC UniTwin and E-laboratory on Complex Computational Ecosystems (ECCE).

EASEA (EAsy Specification of Evolutionary Algorithms) is an Artificial Evolution platform that allows scientists with only basic skills in computer science to implement evolutionary algorithms and to exploit the massive parallelism of many-core architectures in order to optimize virtually any real-world problems (continous, discrete, combinatorial, mixed and more (with Genetic Programming)), typically allowing for speedups up to x500 on a $3,000 machine, depending on the complexity of the evaluation function of the inverse problem to be solved.

Then, for very large problems, EASEA can also exploit computational ecosystems as it can parallelize (using an embedded island model) over loosely coupled heterogenous machines (Windows, Linux or Macintosh, with or without GPGPU cards, provided that they have internet access) a grid of computers or a Cloud.

Release versions
--------------
easea_v2.0 is generally a work in progress.

Changes
--------------
- Added new templates for three Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm: NSGA-II, ASREA, FastEMO
- Deleted boost
- Added the lightweight C++ command line option parser from opensource https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts
- Added event handler and fixed bug when the program is not responding after 1093 evaluations.
- Fixed some bugs in template CUDA_GP.tpl for island model.
- Added in libeasea three performance metrics: HV, GD, IGD 
- Added in libeasea five 2-objective tests (ZDT) and seven 3-objective tests (DTLZ)
- Added in libeasea three crossover operators: SBX, BLX-alpha, BLX-alpha-beta
- Added in libeasea two mutation operators: Polynomial, Gaussian
- Added in libeasea two selector operators: binary tournament (based on dominance comparison and crowding distance comparison), best individual selection
- Added in libeasea dominance estimator and crowdind distance estimator
- Added in libeasea crowding archive module
- Added in libeasea simple logger

Requirements
--------------
This project required you to have flex and bison installed:
```
$ sudo apt-get install flex bison
```
C++ compiler that supports C++14.

Quick start
-------------
- cmake ./
- make
- make install

New templates (MOEA)
-------------
- NSGA-II 
Nondominated Sorting genetic algorithm II (tpl/NSGAII.tpl).
```
$ easea -nsgaii any_benchmark.ez 
```
- ASREA
Archived-Based Stcochastic Ranking Evolutionary Algorithm. (tpl/ASREA.tpl)
```
$ easea -asrea any_benchmark.ez 
```
- FastEMO
Fast Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm. (tpl/FastEMO.tpl)
```
$ easea -fastemo any_benchmark.ez 
```

Benchmark Suite
-------------
- Zitzler-Deb-Thiele's Test Problems ZDT(1, 2, 3, 4, 6) : 2-objective tests (see examples/zdt)
- Deb-Thiele-Laumanns-Zitzler's Test Problems DTLZ(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) : 3-objective tests (see examples/dtlz)

An example to compile zdt1 test with algorithm FastEMO:
```
$ cd examples/zdt1/
$ easea -fastemo zdt1.ez 
```
Performance Metrics
-------------
- Hypervolume (HV) maximisation: it provides the volume of the objective space that is dominated by a Pareto Front (PF), therefore, it shows the convergence quality towards the PF and the diversity in the obtained solutions set.
- Generational Distance (GD) minimization: it measures the average Euclidean distance between the optimal solutions,
obtained by algorithm and those in the Pareto Optimal Front.
- Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) minimization: it is an inverted variation of Generational Distance that: i) calculates the minimum Euclidean distance between an obtained solution and the real PF and ii)  measures both the diversity and the convergence towards the PF of the obtained set (if enough members of PF are known).

To use these performance metrics: 

in your ez-file
```
 #define QMETRICS 
 #define PARETO_TRUE_FILE "pareto-true.dat"
```
where "pareto-true.dat" is a file with Pareto Otimal Front (which is in the same folder as ez-file). See examples in examples/zdt(1-6).ez and examples/dtlz(1-7).ez.

Features
--------------

- Runs can be distributed over cluster of homogeneous AND heterogeneous machines.
- Distribution can be done locally on the same machine or over the internet (using a embedded island model).
- Parallelization over GPGPU cards leading to massive speedup (x100 to x1000).
- C++ description language.
